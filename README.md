# hello-world

CLSnider here! I just started back on GitHub and and I am re-learning the ropes. 
I enjoy programming (why else am I here?), video games, comic books, HP Lovecraft stories,
and learning about the American Civil War. You can find my blog at newguidev.com, where I talk about 
my adventures in learning GUI development!
